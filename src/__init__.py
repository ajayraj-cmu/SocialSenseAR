Perceptual Modulation Engine for Meta Quest 3 Passthrough

A real-time perceptual modulation system for neurodivergent and 
neurodegenerative users. Modifies live passthrough perception 
(video + audio) in a semantically grounded, reversible, sensory-safe way.

Top Priorities (strict order):
1. Sensory safety and user comfort
2. Deterministic, explainable behavior
3. Object-level semantic control (never pixel hacks)
4. Temporal stability (no flicker, no abrupt transitions)
5. Local-first inference with modular extensibility
